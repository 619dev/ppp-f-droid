## 📖 Overview

PaperPhonePlus is a WeChat-style end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application. This repository contains the Android native client, which uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to package the React + TypeScript frontend into an Android APK/AAB.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔐 End-to-End Encryption | Stateless ECDH + XSalsa20-Poly1305, per-message ephemeral keys, forward secrecy |
| 🗝️ Secure Local Keys | Identity and group Sender Keys are protected by Android Keystore; chat caches use a device-bound AES-256-GCM key |
| 📹 Video/Voice Calls | LiveKit SFU for both direct and group calls (up to 100 participants), with discussion and lecture modes |
| 🎙️ Real-time Voice Changer | Voice messages & calls support 3 modes (0.8x / 1.0x / 1.2x) |
| 📱 Session Persistence | Keeps users signed in through network loss, ordinary authorization failures, and server URL changes; signs out only on an explicit server revocation |
| 📴 Offline Access | Account-isolated caching for contacts, groups, chats, Moments, Timeline, and media keeps previously loaded content available offline |
| 👥 Group Chat | Up to 2,000 members, encrypted & unencrypted modes |
| 💬 Rich Messaging | Text, images, video, files, voice messages, message replies, emoji panel, Telegram sticker packs, read receipts |

## 🔐 Extra-encrypted text appearance: design and security boundary

This feature is **extra insurance on top of the existing end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. It does not replace E2EE with a visual encoding, and it never bypasses or weakens the original encryption. Private chats remain protected by the existing X25519 / ML-KEM-768 key agreement and message-encryption path; group chats continue to use the Sender Key protocol. Identity private keys and group Sender Keys remain protected by Android Keystore.

When enabled, every message is processed in this order:

1. The sender first protects the message body with the extra password shared by both participants or by all group members. PBKDF2-SHA-256 (210,000 iterations and a random salt) derives an AES-256-GCM key; every message has an independent random IV and an authentication tag for integrity.
2. The complete extra-encryption frame (version, salt, IV, and ciphertext) is then encoded with one of eight selectable text appearances. This is not merely decorative character substitution: the visible characters carry the extra encrypted ciphertext.
3. That appearance ciphertext then enters the project's original encryption path: private-chat E2EE or group Sender Key encryption. The server still receives the original E2EE/Sender-Key ciphertext plus metadata required for delivery.
4. The recipient reverses the order: first decrypt the original E2EE/Sender-Key layer, then decode the text-appearance frame and decrypt the body with the extra password.

The extra password is never uploaded, synchronized automatically, or distributed by the server. Both people in a private chat must set the same password; every group member who needs to read the plaintext must also set that same password. Text appearances do not need to match: every message carries its own appearance identifier, so the recipient automatically detects and decodes the sender's choice. For example, one person may send Buddhist text while another sends Hangul; if the extra password matches, both decrypt normally. A user's appearance setting controls only the ciphertext appearance of messages they send. If the password is missing, locked, or different, messages are still sent and received normally and the original E2EE layer still decrypts successfully, but the app can display only the appearance ciphertext—not the original text.

The app does not persist the extra password. While unlocked it exists only in the current process memory; locally, the app stores only a random salt and AES-GCM verification data used to check whether an entered password is correct. Users can lock immediately or automatically 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes after the app leaves the foreground. This layer adds an independent shared secret beyond E2EE; it does not replace a strong password, device lock, or system secure storage, and it cannot provide absolute protection on a fully compromised device while the password remains in memory.

## 🔒 Security Model

```
On Registration:
  Device locally generates IK (Identity Key) + SPK (Signed Pre-Key) + 20x OPK (One-time Pre-Keys)
  Public keys uploaded to server; private keys persist in 4 layers, never leaving the device

On Sending Messages:
  Sender downloads recipient's IK public key
  Generates ephemeral ECDH key pair (unique per message)
  X25519 ECDH → shared secret → XSalsa20-Poly1305 encryption
  Ephemeral public key attached to message header; recipient destroys it after decryption

What the Server Sees:
  ✅ Ciphertext blob + routing metadata (sender/recipient UUID)
  ❌ Plaintext / private keys / ephemeral keys / call content
```
